## 3D Feature Descriptors suitable for Registration based on Performance
  [Documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rlW5H1NrMiBt6rW-jM73dyxy5JrsuGpSkpbSgFH9KK4/edit?usp=sharing1)

## Feature Descriptors available in C++ Repo
1. [CSHOT](http://vision.disi.unibo.it/research/80-shot)
2. [PPF Hist](https://gitlab.com/caro-sdu/covis)

## Feature Descriptors available in PCL
1. [ROPS](http://pointclouds.org/documentation/tutorials/rops_feature.php)
2. [FPFH](http://pointclouds.org/documentation/tutorials/fpfh_estimation.php)
3. [PFH](http://pointclouds.org/documentation/tutorials/pfh_estimation.php)

## Note
1. The official tutorials and latest PCL are incompatible
2. Some of the tutorials are updated in PCL "/doc/tutorials/content/sources" 
3. The PCL has changed the format to .PCD
4. In order to use .PLY file from all famous datasets, convert the file using PCL tools "PLY to PCD"
